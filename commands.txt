# file for some common ansible commands and notes

* ansible all --key-file ~/.ssh/ansible -i Inventory -m ping (used to create a connection to all servers in inventory file... -m for module)

* ansible.cfg is the default ansible config file you specify. you can use it to create default ansible values.... after that the ansible command is shortened to just "ansible all -m ping"

* ansible all --list-hosts (to list all your hosts connected to ansible)
 
* ansible all -m gather_facts (to like scrape and list some info on the servers its connected to.... you can add "--limit ip.add.ress" to limit the results to just one host)

* ansible all -m apt -a update_cache=yes (using the apt module, basically the same as running 'apt update'. it wont work because to run that command you need sudo privileges. to get that, add "--become".... if theres a sudo password, add "--ask-become-pass")

* ansible all -m apt -a name=package --become (to install a package on all your hosts)

* ansible all -m apt -a "name=package state=latest" --become (to upgrade an already existing package.... whenever you have more than one argument, add "".... making "state=absent" removes the package from the server)

* ansible playbooks are made using yaml format

* ansible-playbook playbook_file.yml (to run a playbook)

* you can use when statements in playbooks for exceptions to different distrubutions. read up about it when you need it

* you can also use variables in your playbooks using curly braces "{{}}"...after declaring the variables, add their values to the inventory file

* you can use the 'package' module to install packages when you have various distros
